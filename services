# Minimal services file
#
# The traditional full list of services, available from this package:
#    http://sethwklein.net/iana-etc
# is 188KB completely stripped, and doesn't belong in /etc anyway.
#
# This file is not in Baserock right now, but could happily live in
# its own chunk, installed to /usr/share (this might require some
# libc patching to work correctly).
