README for `create-dirs`
========================

`create-dirs` is a tiny project that creates a minimal directory structure
with specified user:group and permissions settings. By default it implements
the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) but this can be overridden by calling
it with a user-provided list.

create-dirs is a re-work of the original fhs-dirs project from Baserock.
